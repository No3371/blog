<meta name="description" content="PatchBay is a free and public service that “patch” Http GET and POST together. For example, you GET from https://patchbay.pub/123 and POST “321” to https://patchbay.pub/123, the GET side will receive “321”. Sounds boring, eh? But it could be the most clever thing I’ve seen these years, and it’s free for anyone to use without any authentication, which enable a lot of possibilities. I’ve made several personal tools based on PatchBay, for example, PushBullet: 400: Invalid request The powershell script takes 1 parameter: the channel name. Channel Name is the only input to PatchBay that decide where you GET from/POST to, so as long as no one share the same channel name with you, we can say the channel is yours. As you may have noticed, the script actually use https://patchbay.pub/pubsub/, which is the pubsub mode of PatchBay, this means all PC running this script will receive data POSTed to the pubsub channel, not just 1 PC." />
